ROCK BEE COLONY DETECTION & MONITORING – REFERENCES AND LINKS:

Several research studies highlight the importance of using technology for monitoring bee colonies and spreading awareness for conservation.
1. Ntawuzumunsi et al. (2021) proposed a Self-Powered Smart Beehive Monitoring and Control System using IoT sensors and mobile applications to remotely monitor beehive conditions.
* This study proves the feasibility of technology-based monitoring systems for bee conservation.
