# Trimerge-RockBees-Hackathon-Stage1
1. 🐝Introduction to Bees and Rock Bees:

Bees are the world’s most essential pollinators and are responsible for 75% of all food produced worldwide.

The Rock Bee (Apia dorsata): Commonly known as Agya Mohal or Hebbenu, it is regarded as one of the largest bees in the world.
Features: They create only one enormous open-air comb, which can extend up to 1 meter in length. They are very protective, defensive, and quite aggressive unless undisturbed, with a peculiar activity pattern based on moonlight nights.

There are two types of Rock Bees:
    
     1. The Giant Rock Bee (Apis dorsata):
•	This is the most common type found across India, from the plains to the lower hills.
•	Size: They are among the largest honey bees in the world with a length of up to 20mm.
•	Nesting: They build a single, large open-air comb which they attach to high-rise buildings, water tanks, or tall tree branches.
•	Behaviour: Highly defensive and they do the famous "shimmering" where a wave-like movement is done synchronously across the hive to scare predators. Climate: They are fond of tropical and subtropical climates and known to migrate hundreds of kilometers during different seasons.

      2. The Himalayan Giant Honey Bee (Apis laboriosa):
•	It is also referred to as the “Himalayan Rock Bee,” this subspecies has a close, specialized cousin in Apis dorsata, which inhabits high-altitude areas.
•	Range: Primarily found in the Himalayan regions (North India, Nepal, Bhutan) between 2,500 and 4,000 meters.
•	Appearance: They are slightly larger in size compared to the regular ‘Rock Bee’ to cope with the low temperatures in the mountains, along with being much “hairier.”
•	Nesting: They construct their nests only on sheer, inaccessible rock faces and never on buildings.
•	Honey: They make a specialty honey called ‘Mad Honey’ out of the rhododendron flower, which is quite rare and requires extreme care because excessive intake can be poisonous.

2. Requirement of Colony Observation Colony:

Public Safety: Rock Bees are “pursuit flyers” capable of chasing potential threats for over 100 meters. There is strict monitoring to avoid disturbing them accidentally.

Livestock Protection: Tethered cattle found in village areas are extremely vulnerable during swarms.

Conservation: Relocation enables professional management, which maintains the function for the ecosystem.

Scientific Data: Understanding the migrational patterns entails the ability to accurately estimate the forthcoming nesting cycles.

3. Research Themes:

○ Species of Bees in IndiaApis dorsata (Rock Bee) - 
Wild, fierce, giant, and honey producers.Apis cerana indica - Indian hive bee; Apis cerana. Small, domesticable bees.Apis florea (Little Bee) - Small, single comb, inhabits bushes. Less threatening.Apis mellifera - European bees. Commercial beekeeping.

○ Rock Bee Habitat & PatternsUrban Habitat - Buildings, water tanks, beneath bridges, billboardsClimbed up into: Trees like the Fig tree (Ficus sp.) & cliff facesMigration Patterns - Migrate through 'Floral Flux'. Depending on nectar, but remain site-loyal; found inhabiting the same buildings year on year.

○ Threat to a CommunityStinging - Due to noise, 'vibration' (AC, construction), and dark-colored clothes.Pheromone Based Attack - 'Isopentyl acetate' (Alarm Pheromone) released by bees. Target marked by stung bee. Entire colony attacks. Respiratory failure & death. Solutions exist in 'Medicure' within hours.

○ Present Technology for Bee SensingAcoustic Sensing - Detection of individual 'flight frequency' (in Hz) between 180 & 250 Hz.Photography - Bee comb (ellipse) recognition by YOLO images & CNN recognition software.heat Vision Sensing - Heat signatures (in 'C) between 33 & 35. Known as 'Thermal Imaging' & 'Thermal Vision Sensing' Technology. Heat contrasting the blue walls.


4. Problem Breakdown & Solution Features:

     1.Implement a real-time risk alert system that notifies users with messages like “⚠ Rock Bee Colony Nearby” when they enter high-risk zones, helping prevent accidental          disturbances and bee attacks.

     2.Integrate AI-based image and video detection that analyzes uploaded photos and videos to automatically identify rock bee colonies and beehive structures, improving            accuracy and reducing false reports.

     3.Add an AI Camera Detection feature that allows users to open the in-app camera and detect beehives in real time using AI, enabling instant identification without              manually uploading media.

     4.Use AI verification to confirm the presence of beehives before marking locations on the map, ensuring reliable and trustworthy colony data.

     5.Provide a “+ Add Colony” option where users can report new colonies by uploading AI-verified photos and videos along with GPS-based location details.

     6.Enable sensor-based bee detection using the mobile microphone to detect nearby bees and identify different bee types based on sound patterns.

     7.Display bee-type-specific first-aid steps and medication guidance to support immediate and correct response after bee stings.

     8.Include a one-tap Emergency SOS button that instantly shares the user’s live location with emergency services.

     9.Allow colony status updates by marking colonies as Active, Relocated, or Removed, keeping monitoring data up to date.

     10.Support offline mode for saving locations and accessing emergency contacts in remote or cliff areas.

     11.Provide multi-language support (English, Nepali, Kannada, Hindi) to improve accessibility for diverse users.

     12.Develop an authority dashboard (future scope) with heatmaps and verified reports to help forest departments and disaster response teams monitor high-risk zones.

     13.Include an education and quiz module to raise awareness about rock bees, mad honey risks, safety do’s and don’ts, and conservation practices.

     14.Implement secure login and signup to manage user access and reporting responsibly.

     15.Provide emergency contact and support options to ensure quick communication during critical situations.
